# Marionette github tracker

This application represents a example of Marionette application. The app works with GitHub, using API v3. It showes two lists: contributers and forks of "backbone.marionette" repository (https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette). Users are able to switch between the lists using simple menu in sidebar.

List of contributers displays nice pictures of the people who comunicate in the repo. In a top of the picture you can see their nicknames. Also you are able to open the person's personal page by clicking on the avatar.

List of froks showes repositories which were branched from this one. You can see simple cards in a list with some information. By clicking on a fork's name, opens fork's page. You are also able to star/unstar the particular fork by clicking on a star icon in a right of the card.

#MarionetteMVC

The applisation has been built on a Backbone.Marionette framework. I've used classical MVC structure for UI logic. Getting data from Github API is located in Models, biseness logic, connecting data and markup is located in Controllers, and in Views described mapping of the data to the html DOM.

Sourses of the project are placed in `js/dev` foulder. There are `coffeescript` for logic and `sass` for markup. For compiled files I remined the structure, to be able to see the structure using devtool of browser.

I've used one main scope for the application - GithhubApp scope in which have been added scopes of all needed classes within the app. Main application is defined in `app.js`. 

All static data for authorisation and some app setting are located in `config.js` file

#CoffeScript

Coffeescript is powerful and pleasure tool for development, in my opinion. I used it for describing of javascript login of a site.

# Bootstrap

I didn't thought a lot about markup. I've used `Bootstrap` for this. It is fast, crossbrowsery and multydevicing. I used `bootstrap-theme.css` for main markup and `http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css` for specific simbols like star and etc.

#Less/Sass

Sass allow to create awesome logic constructions within the front-end applications. It is very handy, but in this particular applicaton it wasn't necessary to use it. Here it's like an area for extensibility.

#Tests

I created a structure for covering the javascript logic by `Unit Tests` and simple examples of using it. Has been used `Jasmin` framework to describing of test's logic and `PhantomJS` for running it in console. The tests are located in `js/tests` foulder.

#Grunt

Grunt is an instrument alowes to make a plan of tasks and walk through it automatically. My `Grantfile.js` do following:

```
1. runs COFFEE compiler in order to create .js files form .coffee files
2. runs SASS compiler in order to create .css files form .SCSS files
3. run Jasmin unit tests
```

Also the application is able to concatinate all javascript files and minimise it, but I didn't do that in order to save visibility
